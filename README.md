## Open Source Datasets and Models

This framework leverages several publicly available datasets:

- **SPHERE_899M**: [Explore on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mohdumar/SPHERE_899M)
- **SPHERE_100M**: [Explore on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mohdumar/SPHERE_100M)
- **SPHERE_100K**: [Explore on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mohdumar/SPHERE_100K)

## Overview

Hermes is an algorithm-system co-design framework that intelligently distributes search clusters across multiple machines, employing hierarchical search along with Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) to significantly reduce retrieval latency and energy consumption. Using open-source LLMs and retrieval indices built on publicly available datasets running on commodity hardware platforms, Hermes achieves:

- **10x reduction in latency**
- **2x improvement in energy efficiency**
