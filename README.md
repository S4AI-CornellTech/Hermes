# Hermes

Hermes is a public, open‚Äêsource evaluation framework implementation for the methodology described in the paper: **"Hermes: Algorithm-System Co-design for Efficient Retrieval Augmented Generation At-Scale"**

---

## Overview

Hermes is an algorithm-system co-design framework that intelligently distributes search clusters across multiple machines, employing hierarchical search along with Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) to significantly reduce retrieval latency and energy consumption. Using open-source LLMs and retrieval indices built on publicly available datasets running on commodity hardware platforms, Hermes achieves:

- **10x reduction in latency**
- **2x improvement in energy efficiency**
