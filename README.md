## Overview

Hermes is an algorithm-system co-design framework that intelligently distributes search clusters across multiple machines, employing hierarchical search along with Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) to significantly reduce retrieval latency and energy consumption. Using open-source LLMs and retrieval indices built on publicly available datasets running on commodity hardware platforms, Hermes achieves:

- **10x reduction in latency**
- **2x improvement in energy efficiency**

## Datastore Creation

### SPHERE Index Creation

- Monolithic Index:
- Evenly Split Indices:
- Clustered Hermes Indices:

Create datastroes based on your own datasets is as simple as changing this line of code in the index creation files ```changed_line```. However, you need to tokenize and encode the dataset to cater towards your RAG model.  

### Synthetic Indices

- Monolithic Index: 
    - Depending on how large of an index you intend to create and the number of cores your machine has access to, indices that make up 1B or 10B vectors can take days or weeks to finish constructing. These indices can also be hundreds of gigabytes in size. 
    - ```python index/create_monolithic_synthetic_index.py --index-size 1m --dim 768 --num-workers 32```
        - index-size: How many vectors will make up the search index (100K, 1M, 10M, 100M, 1B, 10B)
        - dim: Embedding dimension, bert embeddings have a dimension width of 768
        - num-workers: How many cores used to create the index
- Evenly Split Indices:
- Clustered Hermes Indices:

## Hardware Profiling
This section is dedicated to measuring and profiling the retrieval latency performance of Hermes. Detailed instructions and scripts will be provided to help you analyze and optimize the system's latency. If you don't want to profile your own data please see our profiled power and latency on various models and index sizes on different hardware at this website: [Website]
